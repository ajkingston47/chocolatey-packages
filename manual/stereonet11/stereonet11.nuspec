    Academic Users:
    If you work for academic, government, or non-profit institutions you may download and use this software for free. We only ask that you acknowledge the use of these programs in your published papers, talks, and reports. 
    We also ask that you reference the key scientific publications where the algorithms behind the programs are described. 
    Though we definitely want to hear about any bugs that you find, it is always really nice to hear from someone whose life was made a little easier by our software!

    Commercial Users:
    Restrictions on use vary by program and also based on the details of your usage scenario. Please contact Rick Allmendinger (or NÃ©stor Cardozo for any programs on his site) for details.
    Finally, if you find our programs to be useful in your commercial activity, don't you think you should be supporting our research efforts?

    Stereonet 11 is a huge release with a completely new and robust internal data structure and an openGL 3D view of the lower hemisphere for teaching purposes. 
    It includes almost all of the goodness of Stereonet 10 and lots of subtle new tweaks as well (check out the detailed version history, below). 
    This version of Stereonet is compatible with all modern operating systems and has a modern user interface which has been modeled after OSXStereonet for Mac by Nestor Cardozo and me. 
    It can read and write older Stereonet text files, can read the Stereonet 11 binary files, but saves its data in a new binary format. </description>
    
    <releaseNotes>Windows and Linux versions only: The map tab has been removed. If you want to keep the map tab, do not upgrade to this version. Google is dropping support for Internet Explorer which Stereonet for Windows uses internally to show the satellite image. 
    In fact, the map view was always hobbled by the fact that Windows cannot display overlapping controls and therefore Stereonet could never display the strike and dip symbols.
    -Parsing text file and clipboard text dialog now has a column for individual point labels.
    -You can now set the font size of point labels in the Inspector Palette. The font size is specified on a per data set basis so you can use different sizes on different data sets (thanks, Connan).
    -Labels are now carried over when you calculate poles from planes or planes from poles.
    -Various bug fixes</releaseNotes>
